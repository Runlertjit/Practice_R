**Created by Run Lertjitthamrong (ID: 63130500101)**

Choose Dataset:
1. Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books (Data from Thomas Konstantin, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)) >> [Using CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)

### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

# Dataset
books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")
```

This dataset holds a list of 270 books in the field of computer science and programming related topics.
The list of books was constructed using many popular websites which provide information on book ratings an of all the book in those websites the 270 
most popular were selected.



## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `select()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select)). It using for select columns

```
starwars %>% select(name,height)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

//Explain here

```
#Code here
```

Result:

```
#Copy Result from console to here
```
//Explain

- list 1
- list 2

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show relation between height and mass
```
scat_plot <- starwars %>% filter(mass<500) %>% ggplot(aes(x=height,y=mass))+
  geom_point(aes(color=gender))

scat_plot+geom_smooth()
```
Result:
